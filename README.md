# AI4LAM Teaching and Learning

This repository hosts [AI4LAM](https://sites.google.com/view/ai4lam) Teaching and Learning Working Group materials and a [discussion forum](https://github.com/AI4LAM/TeachingAndLearning/discussions).

## The Discussion Forum 

The [discussion forum](https://github.com/AI4LAM/TeachingAndLearning/discussions) aims to provide a place for people to:
- ask questions about using Machine Learning (ML) or Artificial Intelligence (AI) in a Galleries, Libraries, Archives, and Museums (GLAM) context. 
- share projects they are working on using ML in a GLAM setting 
- co-curate some valuable resources in an informal way that is more discoverable than Slack and lower effort than a formal website/directory of materials.
